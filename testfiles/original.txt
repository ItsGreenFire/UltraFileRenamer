#   MADE IN CASE CODE IS ACCIDENTALLY DELETED

'''                  ~~ DIRECTIONS ~~
    CHANGE MODE BEFORE PROCEEDING
For : MODE 0 | Integer
    STEP 0: Add files to 'UltraFileRenamer/oldfiles/'
    STEP 1: Change int value (i) to beginning number of choice.
    STEP 2 (OPTIONAL): Change incrementation to desired int
    STEP 3: Change text and file type (First set of quotes can be left blank if needed)
    STEP 4: Run program and look in 'UltraFileRenamer/newfiles/' for the renamed files
For : MODE 1 | String
    STEP 0: Add files to 'UltraFileRenamer/oldfiles/'
    STEP 1: Change array of strings (s) to how you would like. (Add or subtract strings if needed. If there aren't enough, it will repeat.)
    STEP 2: Change text and file type (First set of quotes can be left blank if needed)
    REMINDER: If you do happen to not have enough strings, make sure to change both lines marked as STEP 2 in MODE 1
    STEP 3: Run program and look in 'UltraFileRenamer/newfiles/' for the renamed files
